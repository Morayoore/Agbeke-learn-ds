# Agbeke-learn-ds
Tracking my path as I turn curiosity into skill -exploring data science world with python, panda and beyond.
This repository is a living journal of my journey into the world of data science. From the basics of python to building real-world projects,this is where I'll be documenting what I learn, create and discover.
## Why this Repo?
I created  space to: 
- Track my progress and stay accountable
- Share useful notes and code
- Reflect on wins,struggles and everything in between
